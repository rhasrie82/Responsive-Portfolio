      <p>My name is Eric Hasrie. I am an aspiring computer coder and former personal banker. I have been in the financial industry for over 10 years and at the moment I am looking for a career change. Something is that is more enjoyable and involves more creativity from a personal standpoint. </p>



      <p>I have worked for only two companies in the financial sector for those 10 years and although I did not stay in that field, I learned so much in the industry.</p>



      <p>My hobbies include playing basketball and reading in my spare time.</p>
